# Carpedia docs
Welcome to the Carpedia docs. This is where the full project is documented, complete with classes, structure, types, and more.

## Project structure
It all starts inside the `src` directory. You'll find three directories and one file inside:

```
src/
├─ assets/
├─ ui/
├─ vehicles/
├─ main.py
```

Let's not worry about the directories for now.
